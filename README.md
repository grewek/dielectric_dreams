# Dielectric Dreams

A Fantasy Computer/Console 

## Plans
This project will combine everything that i like to fiddle with i.e. Architecture of CPUs, Operating Systems, Compilers and probably other stuff
my rough plan is (if i will ever finish it...):

1. Create a 32Bit Emulation of a CPU that is entirely my own.
2. Create a OS for it.
3. Make Tools available, compilers, sprite editors (think of picotron)
4. Make it runnable on a FPGA
