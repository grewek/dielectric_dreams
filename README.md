# Dielectric Dreams

A Fantasy Computer/Console 

## Plans
This project will combine everything that i like to fiddle with i.e. Architecture of CPUs, Operating Systems, Compilers and probably other stuff
my rough plan is (if i will ever finish it...):

1. Create a 32Bit Emulation of a CPU that is entirely my own.
2. Create a OS for it.
3. Make Tools available, compilers, sprite editors (think of picotron)
4. Make it runnable on a FPGA

# Projects

# Dielectric Cpu

This is the project that contains the actual cpu emulation will grow over time

# Dielectric ISA generator

Helpful tool in generating all possible opcodes quickly

# assembler

The assembler for my ISA

# KRISP

A Lisp like low-level language which can be simulated and compiled to either x86-64 or dd ISA.

This thing will be written in C as i need some change in language now and then.
