//NOTE: Achievement for this project:
//      - Get a working Assembler that can produce executable code for my architecture
//      - Trying to get better in TDD but it's usage shouldn't be as dogmatic as many people practice it...
//      - create a lib instead of a binary, i usually always create binaries but i should learn to work more with libs :)
