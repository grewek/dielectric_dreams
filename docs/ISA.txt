# Instruction Set Architecture
Targets:
    * I really like the Motorola 68000 ISA so this is were i am stealing some ideas from!
    * I want the ISA to be as fixed as possible i.e. no extra reads should be necessary for the decoder to figure out what comes next!

Current Issues:
    * The OFFSET seems to be wasted right now...
    * Opcode is probably oversized with 10bits maybe i can scale that down a bit?
    * Figure out a way to create these tables Programmatically? If i need to change things later down the line this will be a mess!!
    * The cycles it needs todo certain operations are just placeholders as i have no fucking clue on how to determine clock cycles from an ideas
      or even from a real processor :| hoping that i can learn that stuff somewhere...or i need an electrical engineer...
    * The Opcode tables will be insanely huge :( 


# Addressing Modes
Atomic - Register to Register Moves.
Immediate - Opcode is followed by a Value of the length specified by the sz field
MemoryDest - Source from Register into MemoryDest.
MemoryDestInc - Source from Register into MemoryDest increment Address of destination register.
MemoryDestDec - Source from Register into MemoryDest decrement Address of destination register.
MemorySrc - Memory Source into Register.
MemorySrcInc - Memory Source into Register increment Address of source register.
MemorySrcDec - Memory Source into Register decrement Address of source register.

# Opcodes

### Legend
  /  = Either a Data Register or an Address Register.
  Imm8 = Immediate Byte value.
  Imm16 = Immediate Word value.
  Imm32 = Immediate Dword value.
